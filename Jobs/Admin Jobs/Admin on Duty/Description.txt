If an admin is on patrol and working to help the rules and stuff, they can switch to being on duty, to make the players know that the rules are being enforced and breaking
them makes you a fuckboy. 

ADMINS CAN ONLY USE ADMIN COMMANDS LIKE NOCLIP AND STUFF WHILST PLAYING AS AN ADMIN ON DUTY, THIS MAKES SURE THAT ADMINS CAN'T ABUSE THEIR POWER WHILST ACTUALLY PLAYING.
IF AN ADMIN ON DUTY GIVES ANYTHING TO A REGULAR PLAYER, LIKE GUNS, MONEY, ETC, THEY ARE BREAKING THE ADMIN RULES AND ARE THUS CLASSED AS A MEGA-FUCKBOY.
