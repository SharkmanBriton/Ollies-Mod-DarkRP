OM VIP is a concept I thought up to help with the upkeep of Ollie's Mod servers. As you might know, Ollie's Mod is paid for by server ads and some money from the owner's own
pocket. 

The idea behind VIP is that it is a paid-for VIP membership for Ollie's Mod and it's servers. A VIP membership would give access to some extra features in OM servers, such
as special jobs for DarkRP, and some other stuff for the other servers, possibly extra commands for use on the Build/War server, or generally just stuff. I'm being very vague
about the features of VIP because they are all to be decided by Ollie himself, but the idea of the VIP programme is to help keep the servers running, and the community
growing. The price of VIP is to be decided by Ollie, but by buying a VIP membership, members of the OM community could directly help the network grow, if the programme
is a success, it could lead to rapid growth of the OM network, new servers, a bigger community, and most importantly, money for the prostitutes down by the Rec.

Possible benefits for VIP are listed here:

For DarkRP
----------
•Access to VIP-exclusive jobs.

For Sandbox
-----------
•More points to spend on hats and crap
•Extra commands, such as (possibly) '!buildmode' to disable pvp for yourself, and, whilst in build mode, '!fly' to fly. (!fly must only be able to be used in buildmode to not
make it P2W shit)




CONCLUSION
-------------

In conclusion, VIP's purpose is to help the servers stay up, and make life easier for Ollie, who works very hard on the servers. VIP is not at all intended to add Pay to win
crap to the network. By getting VIP, members of the community would be able to directly support the server, the network, the creator, and the community.
